## v1.4.0 (April 9, 2025)

### New features
* Introducing support of FSDP in DCP benchmark (#313)
* Exposing max_attempts setting through S3ClientConfig and adding support of S3ClientConfig to DCP (#322)

### Bug fixes
* Consume mountpoint-s3-client changes for race condition on GET request path, that may lead to an empty response 

### Other changes
* Update Pyo3 version (#314)

### Breaking changes
* We changed the way we handle `fork` operations. The CRT client used for communication with S3 is not stable 
during `fork` due to global state and locks held by background threads. To address this, we now clean up all 
existing CRT clients before a `fork` operation and create new CRT clients in the child process. 
This change prevents segfaults and hanging GET requests for training workloads that rely on `fork` (#320)  

## v1.3.2 (February 5, 2025)

### New features
* Consume mountpoint-s3-client changes with support for dots in bucket name for COPY operation introduced in CRT (#300)

* Handle torch.load changes in PyTorch 2.6 (#306)
* Remove dependency on mountpoint-s3-crt (#307)

### Breaking changes
* Internal S3Client now returns `HeadObjectResult` instead of `ObjectInfo`. The only difference is that `HeadObjectResult` doesn't have `key` field.
