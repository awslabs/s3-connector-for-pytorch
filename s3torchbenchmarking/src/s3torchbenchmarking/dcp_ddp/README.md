## PyTorch's Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) benchmarks using DistributedDataParallel (DDP) training

The `dcp` Python package provides a suite of benchmarks designed to evaluate and measure the performance
of [PyTorch's Distributed Checkpointing (DCP)][DCP] feature in comparison to the `s3torchconnector` library.

These benchmarks specifically use DistributedDataParallel (DDP), which is PyTorch's standard approach 
for distributed training where the model is replicated across multiple GPUs/processes. 
With DDP, each process maintains a complete copy of the model parameters, making it suitable for scenarios 
where memory requirements per GPU are manageable.

### Purpose

These benchmarks test both "save" and "load" mechanisms of PyTorch DCP (`torch.distributed.checkpoint.save` and `torch.distributed.checkpoint.load`). The primary objectives are to evaluate the `s3torchconnector` library's performance against other libraries and local storage options, by measuring the following metrics:

**Save Benchmarks:**
- Checkpoint saving throughput (in MiB/s)
- Checkpoint "corrected" save durations (in seconds), which exclude the influence of model load duration on the device

**Load Benchmarks:**
- Checkpoint loading throughput (in MiB/s)
- Checkpoint "corrected" load durations (in seconds), which exclude the influence of process setup and model loading to device

### Configuration

The benchmark runs can be customized through configuration files:

- **Save benchmarks**: [`dcp_ddp_save.yaml`](../../../conf/dcp_ddp.yaml)
- **Load benchmarks**: [`dcp_ddp_load.yaml`](../../../conf/dcp_ddp_load.yaml)

The load configuration includes a `checkpoint.suffix` parameter that specifies which saved checkpoint to load.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A `+path` option is passed to the running script ([`run_dcp_ddp_benchmarks.sh`](../../../utils/run_dcp_ddp_benchmarks.sh)),
> and will be used only if `checkpoint.storage` key includes `disk`.

### Usage

**Save benchmarks (default):**
```bash
./utils/run_dcp_ddp_benchmarks.sh
./utils/run_dcp_ddp_benchmarks.sh --save
```

**Load benchmarks:**
```bash
./utils/run_dcp_ddp_benchmarks.sh --load
```
